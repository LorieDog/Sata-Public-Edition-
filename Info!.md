Sata is a program that right now can do:
  -a bunch of math (however it's limited)
  -tell you what time is it
  -Calculate you the average of something (however it's limited)
Sata is can be run into the terminal but expect a sudden closure after giving you an output (im trying to solve it by giving an exit command)
