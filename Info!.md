Sata is a program that right now can do:
  -a bunch of math (however it's limited)
  -tell you what time is it
  -Calculate you the average of something (however it's limited)
Sata is can be run into the terminal but and after you gave an output to it. Sata will ask to close. Right now you can only say yes but im trying to add a no in it
